- [Effect of post-harvest starvation and rinsing on the microbial numbers and the bacterial community composition of mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor)](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.ifset.2017.06.004)
    - Neither starvation nor rinsing of mealworms after rearing reduced microbial numbers.
    - The bacterial community was dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes.
    - Starvation did not consistently change the bacterial community composition.
- [Rearing Tenebrio molitor in BLSS: Dietary Fiber Affects Larval Growth, Development, and Respiration Characteristics, 2015](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.actaastro.2015.10.003)
    - we suggest that crude fiber content in feed can be controlled within 5-10%, and with the consideration of food palatability, a crude fiber of 5% is advisable.
    - In the whole process of larval growth, 7.74 ± 0.38% (n=3) of the ingested feed was converted to larval body dry mass, while 77.5 ± 1.10 % (n=3) was excreted as frass. 
    -  From the digestion aspect, T. molitor, as a member of the order Coleoptera, has chewing mouthparts [16]
    - Larvae of different growth stages have a different maturity of mouthpart muscle and different ability for biting and chewing, which enables older larvae to adapt to harder materials.
    -  Under a nutrient lacking diet, insects may pupate at a early stage [17] in response to stress.

    - Body lipid content was higher on carbohydrate-rich foods and was positively correlated with starvation resistance.
    - Protein and carbohydrate are the two major macronutrients essential for survival, growth and reproduction in insects ([Chapman et al., 2013](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/the-insects/D40209BE911244B11E7E5E2469232B9A))
    - There has been a growing body of evidence that insects use a variety of behavioural and physiological mechanisms to balance the acquisition of multiple nutrients ([Simpson and Simpson, 1990](https://www.pdcnet.org/schoolman/content/schoolman_1990_0067_0002_0111_0122); [Waldbauer and Friedman, 1991](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1146/annurev.en.36.010191.000355); [Behmer, 2009](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1146/annurev.ento.54.110807.090537); [Clissold et al., 2010](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1098/rspb.2009.2045); [Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012](https://books.google.by/books?hl=en&lr=&id=dzRFczYo8xQC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&ots=BuxxymUevw&sig=kYnDdiywMEF90VwR3ILRYZ-ZXpY&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)).

## Nutrition content

- :exclamation: [Tran et al,  Mealworm (Tenebrio molitor), 2018](https://www.feedipedia.org/node/16401)
- The nutritional value of live mealworm is composed of 20% protein, 13% fat, 2% fiber, and 62% moisture, while the dried mealworm’s nutritional value is composed of 53% protein, 28% fat, 6% fiber, and 5% moisture. The mealworm grease has an acid value of 7.6 (mg KOH/g), iodine value of 96 (g I/100 g), and saponification value of 162 (mg KOH/g) with low peroxide value of 0.27 (mEq./kg) [(Zheng et al., 2013)](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.06.067)
- Fresh larvae contained 56% of water, 18% of total protein, 22% of total fat, and 1.55% of ash. High contents of minerals were found in the larvae: magnesium (87.5 mg/100 g), zinc (4.2 mg/100 g), iron (3.8 mg/100 g), copper (0.78 mg/100 g), and manganese (0.44 mg/100 g). The proportion of n−6/n−3 fatty acids was very advantageous and amounted to 6.76. Larvae powder contained twice higher content of protein, fat, ash, and minerals. Larva of mealworm is a valuable source of nutrients in amounts more profitable for human organism than traditional meat food. Powdered larva is a high-grade product to be applied as a supplement to traditional meals [(Siemianowska et al., 2013)](http://file.scirp.org/pdf/AS_2013062709073464.pdf)
- Lysine was the most abundant indispensable amino acid in the insect larval meals (T. molitor meal), whereas glutamic acid was the most abundant dispensable one. As in T. molitor meal, glutamic acid was the most abundant of the dispensable amino acids. The insect larval meal was a good source of methionine and threonine. The T. molitor meal showed higher lysine, methionine, and threonine contents [(De Marcoa et al., 2015)](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2015.08.006)
- :exclamation: [A systematic review of nutrient composition data available for twelve commercially available edible insects, and comparison with reference values, 2015](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.tifs.2015.10.012)
    - Good tables and reviews!
    - This paper is the first attempt to review systematically and to collate all available nutrient composition data on a subset of commercially relevant edible insects.
    - High consumption of saturated fat, particularly in diets rich in refined carbohydrates, elevates risk of cardiovascular disease (WHO 2003) and current WHO guidelines advise limiting intake of fat and particularly saturated fat (WHO 2015). Therefore species high in saturated fat are unlikely to be ideal for inclusion in the diet of countries with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease and/or a diet based on refined carbohydrates.
