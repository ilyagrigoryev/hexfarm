Please feel free to contribute to the quality of this content by submitting PR's for improvements to references, structuring, explanations, visualizations, etc. If there's any doubt or if you think that a word/phrase is used confusingly, **before submitting a PR, open an issue to ask about it.**

However, if you choose to contribute content (not just typo corrections) to this repo, you agree that you're giving us a non-exclusive license to use that content for our project, as we deem appropriate. You probably guessed that already, but we just have to make sure the lawyers are happy by explicitly stating it.
