## Introduction 

The premise of the project is that current food systems are unsustainable. In fact, as the global population continues to rise, food systems are under greater strain to deliver quality output in a sustainable way. In sustainable food systems, effective use of agricultural land and reducing food waste are central. Insects have gained attention for their ability to effectively convert feed, including feed from food waste, to edible protein-rich products. Tenebrio molitor represents one of the most popular species used for the large-scale conversion of plant biomass into protein and is characterized by high nutritional value.

    - As listed in Table 3, the yellow mealworm contains all the essential amino acids (EAA) needed for human nutrition, and most of the EAA contents are higher than [the requirements suggested by FAO/WHO/UHU](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1111/j.1467-3010.1987.tb00040.x). The proportion of EAA to the total amino acids (E/T) of T. molitor was 44.7%, which satisfies the criteria recommended by FAO/WHO/UHU.
    - The percentage of edible biomass in larval and pupal T. molitor is 100% ([The Yellow Mealworm as a Novel Source of Protein, 2009](http://thescipub.com/PDF/ajabssp.2009.319.331.pdf))
    - The life cycle of T. molitor is short – egg 3–9 day, larva 26–76 day, pupa 5–17 day, and prespawning adult 3–12 day. **Under very suitable conditions, the whole life cycle of T. molitor only needs 38 day** (X.G. Wang, X.W. Zheng, X.Y. Li, J.M. Yao, S.R. Jiang, M. Zhang, Study on the biological characters of Tenebrio molitor L, Chin. Agr. Sci. Bull. 26 (2010) 230–233. In Chinese)
    - T. molitor fed with plant waste diets had **a higher content of protein**, and **a lower content of fat**. According to an FAO report [29], there is suggestive evidence that the intake of animal fat increase the risk of cancers
- [The Yellow Mealworm as a Novel Source of Protein, 2009](http://thescipub.com/PDF/ajabssp.2009.319.331.pdf)
    - **A system in which eggs are separate from adults and hatched in separate chambers would alleviate the danger of losing the larval population due to microbial infection.**
    - For efficient production of larvae, they should be harvested at a weight of 100-110 mg.
    - there is still over one billion people suffering from malnutrition and protein deficiency today [WHO/FAO, 2007. Protein and Amino Acid Requirements for Human Nutrition. World Health Organization/Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations WHO Press, New York.](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf;jsessionid=A2DD03CCD0451B49C412C5D77EAE2B9F?sequence=1)
    - the consumer has probably ingested insects on several occasions as insects are practically omnipresent within all consumed foods of plant origin [Kurtz, O.L. and K.L. Harris, 1962. Microanalytical Entomology for Food Sanitation Control. Association of Official Agricultural Chemists, Washington DC., pp: 576.]
    - [Cotton, R.T., 1963. Pests of Stored Grain and Grain Products. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis, Minnesota, pp: 318.]
    - The insect is most often found in and around dark and damp places
    - The female deposits from 250-1000 eggs with an average of 400-500 eggs. The eggs are bean shaped, sticky, shiny white in color. The eggs are laid singly or in clusters in the food material. They range in length from 1.7-1.8 mm and in width from 0.6-0.7 mm. The incubation period of the eggs is highly influenced by temperature with the optimum being 2 weeks at 25°C. In about 2 weeks, the eggs hatch into larvae.  
    - larva reaches a length of 2.0-2.5 cm
    - The life span of the adult ranges from 37-96 days. Mating takes place within a few days of the emergence and is repeated at intervals throughout the life of the adults.
    - The quality of the protein, and thus the nutritional values, is determined by the amino acid composition
    - **The yellow mealworm contains all the essential amino acids needed for human nutrition.**
    - The results indicate that the larvae must be harvested before they begin to prepare for the pupal stage, as they begin to lose weight at this time. The most efficient period of development for the mealworm is the early larval stage (at about 100-120 mg weight) after which the growth was found to cease and the larvae started to lose weight. */ For the efficient production of insects the larvae should be harvested at 100-110 mg.
    - In addition, insects are fast growing organisms [40], a characteristic that allow the design of a farm system that can respond to changes in demand.
    - **Has section 'Mealworm recipes'**
- [The bacterial biota of laboratory-reared edible mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L.): From feed to frass, 2018](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.03.001)
    - mealworms are a good source of polyunsaturated fatty acids whose consumption is considered as a mean of improving health ([Haddad et al., 2012](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/s00217-012-1759-y); [Osimani et al., 2017c](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/s00217-016-2828-4); [Mozzon et al., 2002](http://www.ftb.com.hr/images/pdfarticles/2002/July-September/40-213.pdf); [Pacetti et al., 2013]()).
    - In some European countries such as the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium and France, mealworms are actually reared by specialized companies.
    - [Gould and Wolf (2017)](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.09.018) concluded that the protein extracted from mealworms could be used as an alternative to current protein-based emulsifiers in food formulations.
    - It is expected that mealworms can be consumed as food or feed without removing the gut. Therefore, any of the microorganisms therein (including pathogens) can be transmitted to human consumers and livestock [(Grau et al., 2017)](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1515/znc-2017-0033).
    - Counts of Enterobacteriaceae detected in the present laboratory study were higher than those reported by [Petruzzelli et al. (2016)](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.08.016) in a four-year study carried out on ovine, bovine and swine carcasses, ranging between 0 and 3.4 log cfu g−1 . This finding can easily be explained by the acknowledged high counts of microorganisms occurring in the gut of mealworm larvae ([Jung et al., 2014](http://www.jmb.or.kr/submission/Journal/024/JMB024-07-02_FDOC_1.pdf)) that in this study had not been degutted before analysis.
    - Even the counts of lactic acid bacteria in mealworms were slightly higher than those reported in the available literature for insect larvae (Stoops et al., 2016; Vandeweyer et al., 2017b) whose lactic acid bacteria load was about 7 log cfu g−1 . Of note, in meat and meat-like matrices these microorganisms can contribute to the generation of unwanted metabolites and the subsequent sensory downgrading of the product (Pothakos et al., 2015), thus suggesting a feasible similar role in mealworm-based foods. 
- [Sustainable farming of the mealworm Tenebrio molitor for the production of food and feed, 2017](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1515/znc-2017-0033)
    - high-protein diets improve larval survival and reduce the duration of development [[41](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1371/journal.pone.0144601)]
    - Microbial safety and shelf life are influenced by the microbial load of the original product [42].
    - Several culture-based studies that measured the number of microbial colony forming units (CFUs) revealed that freeze-dried or fresh mealworms contain large numbers of aerobic bacteria (up to 8 log CFU/g) when the larvae are pulverized. This is higher than the recommended values for minced meat, which is considered comparable (EC 1441/2007) [43–47].
    - The pulverized larvae also contained 7.2 log CFU/g enterobacteria, 3.6 log CFU/g endospores, and up to 5.3 log CFU/g yeast and fungi [43, 45, 46].
    - high microbial load in the mealworms did not include typical food-borne pathogens such as Salmonella spp. or Listeria monocytogenes [43–47].
    - A short heating or blanching step significantly reduced the total bacterial load as well as the enterobacteria count [43, 49].
    - The mealworm cuticle is also covered with microbes due to the larvae eating and defecating in the same environment, but the effects of surface sterilization have not been investigated.
    - Invertebrate pathogens are encountered more frequently in mass rearing systems, often due to overcrowding and stress, such as microsporidian infections in mites reared commercially for pest control [[70](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/s10493-008-9187-1)].
    - The mass rearing of livestock often involves the confinement of animals in crowded conditions where they are bred and managed for maximum yield, with a negative effect on their health and immune system [71].
    - NO ANTIBIOTICS
    - The feeding of freezedried mealworm powder to rats in a safety assessment study did not show any adverse effects, toxicity, or allergy [[88](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.yrtph.2016.03.006)].
    - The acceptance of entomophagy (the consumption of insect-based food by humans) is influenced by price, taste, availability, and established cultural preferences [90–92].
    - Currently, feed based on the lesser mealworm (Alphitobius diaperinus) is 15 €/kg [96], which is far higher than soybean meal (0.33 €/kg) and fish meal (1.22 €/kg) (indexmundi.com/, accessed December 2016). However, the cost of fish and soybean meal will increase in the future, whereas the cost of insect meal will decline [95], thus encouraging the production and consumption of insects.
    - Mealworm larvae are naturally attracted to each other and will form dense clusters [98, 99].
    - The optimal growth temperature is 25 °C–27.5 °C, resulting in a development period lasting 80.0–83.7 days involving 15–17 larval instars [102, 103].
    - Reproductive output per female declined as the adult density and age increased, and the highest reproductive output was with 2–3 weeks after eclosion [106].
    - Probiotic bacteria increase the fitness of the host [108, 109]. They are widely used to improve the growth, survival, and health of livestock and farmed fish [110–115], as well as for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal tract infections in humans [116, 117].
    - The gut microbiota in T. castaneum plays an important role in immune priming, but a cold shock applied to the parents is required for transgenerational immune priming [138, 139]. A similar cold shock approach could be used in mass-reared mealworms, i.e. the parental beetles could be primed by reducing the rearing temperature and the more resistant offspring generation could then be used as food or feed, and for the production of proteins.
    - One way to take advantage of the darkening of the cuticle is the selection of darker beetles for reproduction, which would enhance pathogen resistance at the population level.

    - During the 105-day multi-crew closed integrative BLSS experiment, the overall bioconversion rate of T. molitor reared in the closed system was 8.13%, while 78.43% of feed was converted to frass.
    - T. molitor reared in the closed system had a better nutritional structure compared with other common animal foods, i.e. it had higher protein and lower fat contents, and good essential amino acid and essential fatty acid compositions.
    - T. molitor larvae reared in the closed system had a relatively low growth rate compared with those reared in an open environment under the same feeding regime and conditions, which indicated that the environment of closed system has an adverse impact on larval growth.

## Extraction

### Protein

- [Yellow Mealworm Protein for Food Purposes - Extraction and Functional Properties, 2016](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147791&type=printable) 
    - A protocol for extraction of yellow mealworm larvae proteins was established, conditions were evaluated and the resulting protein extract was characterised. The freeze-dried yellow mealworm larvae contained around 33% fat, 51% crude protein and 43% true protein on a dry matter basis. The true protein content of the protein extract was about 75%, with an extraction rate of 70% under optimised extraction conditions using 0.25 M NaOH, a NaOH solution:ethanol defatted worm ratio of 15:1 mL/g, 40°C for 1 h and extraction twice. The protein extract was a good source of essential amino acids. The lowest protein solubility in distilled water solution was found between pH 4 and 5, and increased with either increasing or decreasing pH. Lower solubility was observed in 0.5 M NaCl solution compared with distilled water. The rheological tests indicated that temperature, sample concentration, addition of salt and enzyme, incubation time and pH alterations influenced the elastic modulus of yellow mealworm protein extract (YMPE). These results demonstrate that the functional properties of YMPE can be modified for different food applications.

    - Lactic fermentation of composite flour/water mixtures containing 10, or 20% powdered roasted mealworm larvae resulted in successful acidification and was demonstrated effective in safeguarding shelf-life and safety by the control of Enterobacteria and bacterial spores. 
    - An ever-increasing world population, combined with a steadily rising economic growth and urbanization results in increasing demand for high-value protein; this will consequently augment the pressure on the worlds’ livestock production sector. This development almost certainly has a negative impact on the environment, considering carbon emissions, land and water use, public health risks etc. ([Alston, Beddow, & Pardey, 2009; FAO, 2006](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1126/science.1170451)).
    - Lower counts of sporeforming bacteria were determined in mealworm larvae than in house- and large crickets, which is most likely related to farming practices. Mealworm larvae are grown in wheat flour, whereas large crickets are caught from the soil or farmed in containers containing soil (particularly house crickets). These findings are comparable to the data of [Mpuchane et al. (2000)](http://sci-hub.tw/10.2307/40980272).
    - however a remaining potential risk with edible insects is the presence of sporeforming bacteria which are most probably introduced through soil contact and cannot be fully eliminated by boiling.

- [The microbiota of marketed processed edible insects as revealed by high-throughput sequencing](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.fm.2016.09.012)
    - Viable pathogens such as Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes were not detected.
    - Food spoilage bacteria were also found, 380 as well as Spiroplasma spp. in mealworm larvae, which has been found to be related to neurodegenerative diseases in animals and humans

    - The gut bacteria community structure was not significantly affected by the presence of antibiotics or by the exposure of T. molitor larvae to a highly diverse soil bacteria community.
    - we suggest that the environment in the gut of T. molitor larvae selected a specific group of bacteria, such as Spiroplasma, and that as a result, the bacterial community of a T. molitor larva is very stable regardless of the external environment.

    - Freeze-dried cells containing PHA granules can be fed to mealworms.
    - Mealworms partly digest the cells but not the PHA granules.
    - Partially purified intact PHA granules are excreted in the form of fecal pellet.
    - The PHA granules can be further purified by water and detergent.
    - The properties of PHA granules were similar to chloroform extracted PHA.

## Market

- [Profiling consumers who are ready to adopt insects as a meat substitute in a Western society, 2014](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodqual.2014.07.008)
    - One out of five meat consumers claims to be ready to adopt insects.
    - Males are 2.17 times more likely than females to adopt insects.
    - Consumers who plan to reduce meat intake are 4.51 times more likely to adopt insects.
    - Significant effects of food (technology) neophobia and familiarity are confirmed.
    - Belief that meat is healthy and focus on meat taste lower readiness to adopt insects.
    - [Hoek et al. (2011: 672)](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.appet.2011.02.001) state that ‘‘simply providing information about, and increasing awareness of the environmental benefits of eating meat substitutes is not likely to be very effective’’
    - One promising strategy might be to focus on communicating with consumers who are planning to reduce their meat intake about the production and the eating of insects.
    - This study shows that 154 W. Verbeke / Food Quality and Preference 39 (2015) 147–155 it is very unlikely that ‘typical’ Western meat lovers would consider including insects in their diet.
- [The psychology of eating insects: A cross-cultural comparison between Germany and China, 2015](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodqual.2015.04.013)
    - The introduction of insects as a food source in Western societies seems more likely to succeed if insects are incorporated into familiar food items, which will reduce neophobic reactions and negative attitudes towards insect-based foods.
    - Overcoming attitudinal barriers, such as negative taste expectations and neophobic reactions, through familiarity enhancement and taste education is paramount to establishing insects as a food source.
    - Insect-based foods and dishes that are Westernised and adapted to European flavour profiles, textural preferences and food aesthetics are more likely to find their way into consumers’ diets
- [Consumer acceptance of insect-based alternative meat products in Western countries, 2016](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodqual.2016.05.004)
    - Mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L.) reared in our laboratory on wheat flour, brewer’s yeast, and wheat bran were used in this study. The insects were fasted for 24 h before they were killed by freezing, to ensure that they have excreted all feces. This procedure allowed us to reduce the bacterial load in the insect gut and to offer a safe product for human consumption. Nevertheless, microbiological tests were conducted to ensure the harmlessness of insect preparations to respondents. [Connected with [Processing](#processing)]
    - Burger recipes (beef, lentils, mealworms and beef, mealworms and lentils)
    - Microbiological analysis: no E. coli or C. perfringens was found in the samples. Pre-tasting microbiological analyses revealed total viable counts, expressed in log colony forming units (cfu)/g, below the standard legal maximum for fresh minced meat (5.70; BB, 4.88 log cfu/g; MBB, 5.04 log cfu/g; MLB, 5.28 log cfu/g; LB, 5.23 log cfu/g) (CE No 2073/2005, 2005). [Connected with [Safety](#Safety)]
    - Burger tasting session: 79% of respondents (35 (44%) men and 44 (56%) women. . All participants were Belgian, and the majority (88%) were of Caucasian origin; 12% of participants identified as African, Asian, and Latin American) thought that we will eat insects in the future and 68% of them were ready to add insects in their customary diet. The preferred form of integration was minced (48%), followed by powder (33%) and whole insects (19%).
    - Taste is an important factor in the acceptability of a novel food product.
    - Our findings support the hypothesis that younger consumers are ready to adopt new meat substitutes or novel food as insects ([Schösler et al., 2012](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.appet.2011.09.009);[Tuorila, Lähteenmäki, Pohjalainen, & Lotti, 2001](https://bit.ly/2JEGyDH); [Verbeke, 2015](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodqual.2014.07.008)).
    - Finally, most (~70%) of the participants were convinced that we will eat insects in the future and were ready to include insects (principally minced or powder) in their diet. These results are consistent with those reported by Caparros Megido et al. (2014), but contrast with those of Vanhonacker et al. (2013), De Boer et al. (2013b), and Verbeke (2015), who found that the potential for the introduction of insects as food currently ranges from nonexistent to dependent on form. This difference may be explained by study design; the previous studies did not include tasting sessions and, as previously written, people probably rely only on non-experimental sources of information (e.g., emotional memories, self-knowledge, or intuitive theories) to respond instead of the real insect sensory properties.

    - before attempting to introduce insects into diet, one of the main issues is to normalize entomophagy by educating the Western population that insects are a legitimate food source.
    - the first exposure to a new food affects the likelihood of consuming it in the future ([Tuorila et al., 1994](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1006/appe.1994.1056))
    - visual appearance and food texture are closely related to food acceptance ([Logue et al., 1981](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/0005-7967(81)90053-X))
- [The insectivore’s dilemma, and how to take the West out of it, 2015](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodqual.2015.02.007)
    - Current strategies identify the cultural representation of insects as disgusting as main obstacle.
    - Arguments about environmental or nutritional benefits are not sufficient to shift people’s choices toward entomophagy. Rational arguments in-and-of themselves are unlikely to introduce change in the culture and in our insect- or insect-related food behaviors.
    - Decades of laboratory research, as well as years of experience in gastronomy, suggest that people’s food choices are relatively immune to rational changes of representation, and instead tend to be driven by taste preferences and exposure.
- [Consumer acceptance of insect-based foods in the Netherlands: Academic and commercial implications, 2016](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.appet.2016.07.023)
    - Reports qualitative research with consumers of insect-based foods.
    - Distinguishes between initial motivations and repeat consumption factors.
    - Factors affecting repeat consumption are highly conventional.
    - Redirects attention to the practicalities of (novel) food consumption.
    - Extends literature on consumer acceptance of edible insects and novel foods.
    - The initial motivations included a general interest or curiosity, a feeling that Insecta products were more environmentally-friendly or sustainable than conventional meat products, a feeling that Insecta products were good for one's health, and/or the introduction of novelty and variety into diets. These findings support previous research into motivating factors and the likely characteristics of early adopters of insects as food ([Sogari, 2015](http://www.mattioli1885journals.com/index.php/progressinnutrition/article/download/4960/3651); [Verbeke, 2015](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodqual.2014.07.008)).
    - However, most of the main factors affecting repeat consumption were notably more practical and contextual, and associated with the routine consumption of more conventional foods. These were the price, taste, and availability of products, and their degree of fit with established dietary practices, including the accommodation of other people's preferences. Another influential factor more closely related to initial motivations was the status of Insecta products as a source of protein that was seen as more ‘ethical’ than conventional meat, either for environmental or animal welfare reasons. Repeat consumption typically required the successful interplay of all these factors. Negative factors, such as when participants found the products too expensive and largely unavailable, led to their ‘passive rejection’ as foods ([Shelomi, 2015](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.tifs.2015.06.008)), despite a willingness otherwise to eat them. The cognitive emphasis implied by ‘passive rejection’ could perhaps be better conceptualised as a ‘failure to integrate’ into established eating practices. For most participants, practical, supra-individual factors appeared to exert a greater influence on repeat consumption than more rationalised considerations about the ethical position of insect-based foods. This suggests that product attributes, practical and contextual factors, and considerations of existing dietary practices, habits and routines should receive a greater emphasis in consumer acceptance research than has hitherto been the case. 
    - participants often prioritise practical factors, such as price, above ethical principles
    - Research on the acceptance of insects as food has also suggested that insects are likely to be more acceptable to Western consumers when they are disguised or incorporated in familiar foods, rather than visible ([Gmuer et al., 2016](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodqual.2016.07.003); [Hartmann et al., 2015](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodqual.2015.04.013); [Lensvelt & Steenbekkers, 2014](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1080/03670244.2013.879865); [Schosler et al., 2012](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.appet.2011.09.009); [Tan et al., 2015](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodqual.2015.01.013 )), and some researchers have suggested that incorporation into convenience foods might be one of the most acceptable ways in which to introduce edible insects to Western diets ([Schosler et al., 2012](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.appet.2011.09.009); [Verbeke, 2015](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodqual.2014.07.008)).
    - an ‘ingredient’ type insect-based product were produced, it may be easier for people to integrate it into their culinary routines, which may encourage greater or more regular uptake.
    - Another reason for the current limited uptake may relate to insects' position as an invisible, ‘ethical’ protein source. A significant shift in Western consumer focus towards the protein content of foods has been observed in recent years ([Gray, 2015](https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2015/08/06/Protein-trends-Saturation-point-or-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg); [Scott-Thomas, 2013](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2013/08/02/High-protein-trend-to-hit-Europe-whether-we-need-it-or-not); [Starling, 2015](http://www.nutraingredients.com/Markets-and-Trends/Mainstream-keen-on-protein-foods-but-supplements-still-rule)), and the consumption of abstracted forms of protein as a relatively instrumental activity (such as for muscle gain or weight loss) appears from market research sources to be increasingly popular, having branched out from specialised areas such as the exercise market ([Scott-Thomas, 2013](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2013/08/02/High-protein-trend-to-hit-Europe-whether-we-need-it-or-not); [Starling, 2015](http://www.nutraingredients.com/Markets-and-Trends/Mainstream-keen-on-protein-foods-but-supplements-still-rule)). Protein may be a particular concern for those looking to replace conventional meat with more ethical alternatives, a possibility suggested by recent increases in sales of plant-based protein ([Crawford, 2015](https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2015/08/06/Mainstream-keen-on-protein-foods-but-supplements-still-rule); [Gray, 2015](https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2015/08/06/Protein-trends-Saturation-point-or-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg)), as indeed by the present study. Yet for many vegetarian consumers, insects are still animals, raising ethical problems about eating them (e.g. [Vegetariersbond, 2016](https://www.vegetariers.nl/organisatie/veelgestelde-vragen/wat-vindt-de-vegetariersbond-van-het-eten-van-insecten)). Insectbased convenience foods seem better suited for the meat-reducer or ‘flexitarian’ market, or for environmentally-motivated vegetarians who do not completely rule out the consumption of some animals. That some people from this group are buying them is borne out by the empirical data presented above.
    - Indeed if the products are tasty and distinct, as well as being affordable and easily available, higher levels of consumption are likely to follow.
- [Insects as food: Exploring cultural exposure and individual experience as determinants of acceptance, 2015](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodqual.2015.01.013)
    - they were uneasy about the idea of eating insects and uncertain about the benefits, where they often mentioned a lack of knowledge on the production, safety, preparation and availability as reasons not to eat insects.
    - "I will eat insects if I didn’t see their shape"
    - The Thai participants generally rejected the other species that have never been eaten or seen before: “Because I never ate it before, my parents never showed me how to.” (T/E on mopane worms)
    - “It looks like worms in dead animal, it is rotten... I remember that image so it is not appetizing for me.” (T/E on mealworms)
    - “For me it is also that they do not resemble insects... this would not really be an insect, but a worm...I don’t see any wings, I don’t see any crunchy outside shells, no legs indeed.” (D/NE on mealworms)
    - **insects were more appropriately prepared in a savoury rather than a sweet manner**
    - **Anyway it should be more available, just in the supermarket and not only in expensive specialty stores, and just less expensive**
    - **I think if you want to sell it you should retain its character... they have their own unique taste and flavour... insect will be forgotten like insect in cookies [chocolate], it didn’t have any insect flavour**
    - However, the cognitive arguments (e.g. health and environmental benefits) were found to be insufficient to encourage consumption, and acceptance of insects as food would require the development of appropriate products that not only lower the barriers to trying, but also taste good and deliver the benefits that consumers are interested in.

    - online survey
    - In an open question the participants were asked to explain the risks they associate with eating insects. Of the 167 participants that answered this question, 50 participants mentioned not to associate any risks with eating insects. Two risks that were mentioned most commonly were that insects could carry diseases, bacteria or infections (n = 35) and that people might get sick after eating them or think eating insects is too “scary” (n = 27). Interestingly, numerous participants listed factors that would not normally be seen as “risks” when answering this question. For example the fact that the idea of eating insects is unattractive and the “Yucky taste, texture in the mouth”. One participant stated: “I have always experienced insects as being pests and hazardous to your health, so seeing them in food makes me think that eating it could make me sick.”
    - the results from the survey indicate that information is seen as trustworthy when provided by scientific researchers, persons using the product, the government and well known relatives, but not when it is promoted by food producers or famous persons
    - The participants are thus more likely to eat insects mixed into a dish than to eat them individually. Participants are also more likely to eat insects when they are unrecognizably incorporated in a product.
